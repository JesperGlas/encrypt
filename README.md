# Simple Encrypt

## Description
A project that turns strings into gibberish and then back again. Perfect for mildly secret correspondence.

## How it works
It's a terminal based program so it's run from the command line. Make sure all files are in the same directory and compiled.

## How to encrypt
- Write what you want to encrypt in the input.json file and save it
- Navigate to the directory containing the program in the terminal
- Run "java Encrypt input.json"
- Your encrypted message is now printed in the terminal and saved in the output.json file

## How to decrypt
- Paste the encrypted message you've recieved/made in the input.json file
- Navigate to the directory containing the program in the terminal
- Run "java Decrypt input.json"
- Your decrypted message is now printed in the terminal and saved in the output.json file
